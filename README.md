# react-shared-state

A repository for demonstrating shared state without Redux or React hooks. Follows the ideas behind https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html.

Also demonstrates how using this method allows for reuse of the child components, since they are more loosely coupled from the state itself.

See comments within the code for more information about what's going on.
